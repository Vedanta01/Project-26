Baking macaroni and cheese is optional. I always bake my mac and cheese further as it tastes so good. But if you donâ€™t have an oven or the time, then just mix and serve.
Do top with breadcrumbs when baking as they add a lovely crispy and crunchy layer.
Feel free to add seasonings, herbs and spices of your choice. I keep it simple with crushed black pepper and a bit of ground nutmeg. A dash of mustard powder also perks up the flavor.
To add some fiber and extra nutrition to in the dish, simply mix in some steamed veggies.
